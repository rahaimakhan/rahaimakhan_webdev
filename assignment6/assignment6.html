As an obsessed amateur photographer, I spend too much time reading photography forums on the Internet. Not long ago, I came across a particularly plaintive discussion. “Let’s say, hypothetically, I’d like my future great, great grandchildren (and their offspring) to see some of my photos,” someone wrote. “Not necessarily hundreds or thousands of my photos. Maybe just a few.” What would it take to make this possible? The responses piled up, full of cautionary notes. Pictures could be stored digitally, but there was a good chance that today’s files wouldn’t work on tomorrow’s computers. They could be stored physically (on archival paper, in archival boxes), but could still suffer from leaky basements or moving-day chaos. Ultimately, the biggest obstacle was attention, or the lack of it. Why would your descendants care about your pictures? Lots of people have old photos showing long-dead relatives they can’t identify. The bottom line seemed to be that, if you weren’t a great artist, or didn’t photograph moments of historical importance, then your photos would die with you.

Photographs don’t have to be art: in a recent book, the critic Nathan Jurgenson explored the rise of “social photos” the immediately sharable dressing-room selfies, appetizer snapshots, and view-from-the-hotel-balcony landscapes that aren’t meant to be art works but are, instead, “about developing and conveying your view, your experience, your imagination in the now.” But, even though I share some of my photos with family and friends, they aren’t social. They’re made for broadly artistic reasons, even though they’re just everyday photographs.

As a photographer myself, I’ve thought about this dilemma often. What will happen to all the photos in the long run? I know that technology changes fast, and there’s no guarantee that the digital files we carefully organize today will be accessible decades from now. Even physical prints, no matter how well stored, might one day be forgotten in a box or lost in a move. But despite this uncertainty, I don’t believe the value of our photographs depends on whether they last forever. They are a reflection of our perspective, our experiences, and the way we human see the world differently in the present. Maybe they don’t need to be preserved for generations to have an impact. They matter simply because they exist now.

</p>

<p>
I don’t take pictures just to share them; I take them because photography is how I see and understand the world. Like Jurgenson describes, there’s a difference between “social photos” meant for instant sharing and the kind of images I create. My work isn’t always grand or extraordinary it’s often just light falling in a particular way or a moment that feels right. But even in those simple, everyday shots, I find meaning. They help me remember, reflect, and appreciate the patterns in life that might otherwise go unnoticed. Whether or not my photos survive beyond me, they’ve already served their purpose in shaping how I experience the world.
