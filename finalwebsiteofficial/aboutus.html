    <p>The Hidden Frequency Theory Institute (HFTI) consists of a group of scientists, sound engineers, and historical researchers dedicated to uncovering the true power of sound frequencies.</p>
	
    <p>We are here to challenge that oversight. By restoring lost frequencies, we aim to:</p>

    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li>Uncover lost frequency ranges removed from modern sound technology.</li>
      <li>Provide tools for individuals to reclaim their auditory environment and tap into higher states of awareness.</li>
      <li>Restore suppressed knowledge for human advancement.</li>
      <li>Unlock the natural healing potential of the human body.</li>
      <li>Promote awareness through research and community.</li>
      <li>Empower people to unlock their full cognitive potential.</li>
      <li>Enhance cognitive function and emotional balance through sound therapy.</li>

  <div class="memorial-text">
    <h3>Dr. Daniel Mead (1939-2007)</h3>
    <h3>Founder of HFTI</h3>
    <p>Dr. Daniel Mead was a German-American physicist, neuroscientist, and acoustic researcher whose work, though largely unrecognized in mainstream science, laid the foundation for what is now known as the Hidden Frequency Theory. Born in 1939 in Dresden, Germany, Mead grew up in a post-war Europe where silence and chaos often shared the same room. This paradox sparked in him a lifelong fascination with sound—not merely as a medium of communication, but as a fundamental force of life.</p>
    <p>After relocating to the United States in his early twenties, Mead studied at MIT, where he earned a dual doctorate in biophysics and acoustic engineering. Unlike many of his peers who gravitated toward militarized or commercial applications, Mead ventured into the more esoteric: the intersection of sound, consciousness, and healing.</p>
    <p>In the early 1970s, Dr. Mead published a series of groundbreaking internal papers exploring the biological effects of specific sound frequencies. Most notably, he conducted extensive research on the 528 Hz frequency, which he believed resonated with the core of human DNA. His experiments, conducted in isolation and secrecy, revealed stunning effects: accelerated cellular repair, reduced stress hormones, enhanced emotional balance, and increased neural plasticity.</p>
    <p>His peers, however, dismissed his findings as pseudoscience. Mainstream journals refused to publish his work, and university funding was abruptly cut. Mead became a target of ridicule—but he never stopped. Instead, he went underground.</p>
    <p>Between 1978 and 1995, Mead is believed to have conducted over 300 private studies with volunteers ranging from trauma survivors to artists. Many of these participants later reported heightened states of clarity, creativity, and emotional regulation after exposure to "restored frequencies" — particularly those missing from the modern musical scale.</p>
   <p>In the late 1990s, Dr. Mead confided to a few close colleagues that he believed certain frequencies had been intentionally removed from public awareness. He theorized that a global shift in the musical standard, from 432 Hz to 440 Hz, was not accidental but part of a broader effort to suppress human consciousness. He began to collect historical, spiritual, and acoustic evidence that hinted at a long-standing cover-up.</p>
   <p>Then, in 2001, after presenting his unpublished manuscript, The Hidden Harmonics, at a private symposium in Zurich, Dr. Mead vanished. His last known contact was a phone call to his daughter, in which he reportedly said, “They’re close. If anything happens, don’t trust what they tell you.”</p>
   <p>A missing persons report was filed, but no traces were ever found. In 2007, he was legally declared dead.</p>
   <p>Yet his work lived on. Among his belongings, a single hard drive was recovered—encrypted, but not destroyed. A group of his former students and associates, calling themselves the Hidden Frequency Theory Institute (HFTI), devoted the next decade to decoding, studying, and continuing his legacy.</p>
   <p>What they found on the drive was astonishing: schematics for frequency-based therapeutic devices, lost manuscripts, recordings of experimental soundscapes, and a thesis that laid out the entire framework of The Hidden Frequency Theory.</p>
   <p>Since then, HFTI has operated as both a memorial and a movement—dedicated to rediscovering, preserving, and activating the lost potential hidden in sound. Through rigorous research, field experiments, and public education, the institute honors Dr. Mead’s lifelong pursuit and aims to awaken the world to the resonance it has forgotten.</p>
   <p>Dr. Daniel Mead is now considered not just a pioneer of frequency medicine, but a symbol of scientific courage, whose sacrifice made it possible for future generations to explore a truth long buried in silence.</p>
